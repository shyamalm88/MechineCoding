> Word Ladder II (LeetCode #126)

A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary
wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

1. Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
2. Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need
```text
   to be in wordList.
```

3. sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return
all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an
empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a
list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

Example 1:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]

Example 2:
Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: []

Constraints:
- 1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
- endWord.length == beginWord.length
- 1 <= wordList.length <= 500
- wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
- beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
- beginWord != endWord
- All the words in wordList are unique.
